## Summary

Quantifying the myelin sheath radius of myelinated axons *in vivo* is critical for understanding, diagnosing, and monitoring various neurological disorders. Despite advancements in diffusion MRI (dMRI) microstructure techniques, models specifically designed to estimate myelin sheath radii have remained unavailable.  

This proof-of-concept study introduces two novel dMRI models that characterize the dMRI signal from water diffusion confined to cylindrical surfaces, approximating myelin water diffusion. Key contributions include:  

1. **Derivation of spherical mean signals**, eliminating fiber orientation and dispersion effects.  
2. **Extension of the models to multiple concentric cylinders**, mimicking the layered structure of myelin.  
3. **A method to convert histological distributions of axonal inner radii** into myelin sheath radius distributions.  
4. **Analytical expressions** to estimate effective myelin sheath radii.  

Monte Carlo simulations in cylindrical and spiral geometries validate the models, demonstrating agreement with analytical predictions. Simulations also reveal strong correlations between effective radii derived from histological distributions and those obtained by fitting the dMRI signal to a single-cylinder model.
